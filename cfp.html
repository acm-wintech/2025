                <p align="justify">ACM WiNTECH has advanced to its 19th anniversary as one consolidated tradition for bringing together an important
                    number of researchers and industry players working in different aspects of experimental wireless communications
                    and networking. The workshop will continue to serve as a forum for sharing new ideas and experiences gathered
                    across all experimental aspects of wireless networks and systems, such as the methodological and technical issues
                    that must be faced for defining, running, controlling, and benchmarking experiments on wireless solutions. The
                    workshop will also facilitate discussions of key unresolved challenges and emerging problems in the field, such as
                    new laboratory methodologies, key real-life limitations of current and novel wireless technologies that have emerged
                    over the past few years (including mmWave, TeraHertz, 5G and beyond, Open RAN, IoT, VLC, wearables,Workshop Proposal

                    underwater and aerial networking, and software-defined wireless networking), as well as key challenges facing the
                    wireless networking of the future.
                    We are seeking original, previously unpublished papers empirically addressing key issues and challenges in
                experimental wireless networking. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:<br/></p>

    <p>Papers should contain original material and not be previously published or currently submitted for consideration
        elsewhere. All submissions will be judged by their technical merit and relevance to the workshop, based on reviews
        by the Technical Program Committee.
        Manuscripts must be submitted by using the HotCRP conference management system at <a href="https://wintech2025.hotcrp.com" target=”_blank”><u>https://wintech2025.hotcrp.com</u></a>.
        Prospective authors are encouraged to submit a single PDF file with all fonts embedded, using the ACM conference
        proceedings format (use the same PDF formatting guidelines as the main conference). Paper length is limited to eight
        (8) pages (in two-column, 10-point format), all-inclusive (references, figures, etc.). Papers must include author names
        and affiliations for single-blind peer reviewing by the program committee. Authors of accepted papers are expected to
        present their papers at the workshop. Accepted papers will be published in the ACM WiNTECH proceedings and will
    be archived in the ACM Digital Library. All papers will be considered for the Best Paper Award.</p>
